USAGE="
git split [<commit-id>] [-s]

Split a git commit into two separate commits, preserving the original
message and creating a new commit with the changes you selected to be removed
from the original.

If no <commit-id> is specified HEAD^ will be used. Running this command will
kick you into an interactive 'git reset -p' prompt where you choose which
diffs you no longer want in the original commit. Once finished, a git commit
prompt will appear where you write the NEW commit message. Any changes you
picked to remove will go in this new commit.

[<commit-id>]	Commit you wish to split into 2 commits. If no commit-id is
		specified HEAD^ will be used.

-s		Use if you want the new split commit to contain a
		Signed-off by line"
